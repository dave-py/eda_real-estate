# **EDA on Real Estate Values**

This is my first project during my time at NeueFische Bootcamp, Hamburg. I explored a dataset consisting data of about 21.000 house-prurchases in Kings County, Washington State.

The project encompasses the whole EDA-process, including Data Mining, Cleaning, Exploration as well as a prediction part.

Please have a look into my presentation slides and the Jupyter Notebook for more detailed information.
